# CampShare

## Overview

CampShare is an outdoors-focused media platform that will help you find new campgrounds to explore! Users can find, read about, comment on, and provide their own impressions of campgrounds across the country.

If you're particularly keen on the outdoors, you have the choice to apply to become a contributor. Contributors create campground posts with personal descriptions and original photos. Contributors are the foundation of CampShare!
